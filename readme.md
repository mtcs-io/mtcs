# MTCS
make the complicated simple

## What the fuck?
We want MTCS to be a simple CMS for small websites or blogs.

### Why another platform?
* We were sick and tired of picking Wordpress for small websites because it's the cheapest way.
* We want to have an easy way to implement custom functionalities.

### What's the base?
MTCS is built on top of some of the most modern technologies in the web:
* Laravel
* Webpack
* Vue.js
